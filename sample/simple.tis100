ADD UP       # Gets input and adds it to ACC, the only addressable register in a T-21
G:           # Defines a label called "G"
SUB 2        # Subtracts 2 from ACC
JGZ G        # If ACC is greater than 0, jumps to G
MOV ACC DOWN # Sends the value of ACC to the first available neighbor; in this case, output.
             # Implicitly jumps back to the first line
