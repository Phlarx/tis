# TIS-100
A TIS-100 emulator, for the wonderful Zachtronics game of the same name. Uses TIS-100 save file format.

None of the others available did quite what I wanted, so I'm going to try my hand at making my own.

This is all very WIP, so a bunch of things aren't implemented. However, the instruction set should be functional
and complete. Also no documentation yet, sorry. It's on my short list.
